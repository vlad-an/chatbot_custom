# Movie Corpus Chatbot

## Introduction
This project is a chatbot built using PyTorch and trained on the "movie-corpus" dataset from Cornell University's conversational analysis toolkit, ConvoKit. The chatbot employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with attention, allowing it to generate human-like responses based on the context of a conversation. This model integrates deep learning techniques to understand and produce text, making it a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks.

## Features
- Sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism.
- Trained on the "movie-corpus" dataset for diverse conversational context.
- Implements encoder-decoder architecture.
- Utilizes PyTorch for model development and training.
- Offers functionalities for both training and inference.
- Computes evaluation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and DISTINCT_N scores.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and PyTorch installed. There is a requirements.txt file provided too.
